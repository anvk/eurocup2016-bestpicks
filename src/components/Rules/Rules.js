          <p>
            You are required to select ONE team from all POTs plus a 5th team from any of the POTs. These teams will carry through the entire tournament (round robin and playoffs) so you will continue to earn points as long as the team is playing.

          <h2>PLAYOFF SELECTION (Bracket Selections)</h2>
          <p>
            You are required to select the 16 teams that make it to the round of sixteen, the 8 teams that will be in the quarter finals, the 4 teams in the semi finals, the 2 finalists, and the winner of the tournament.
          </p>

          <h2>POINTS</h2>

            <li>
              POT Teams: You will be awarded 3 points for each win, and 1 point for a draw by your teams. Also 1 point is awarded for each goal scored by your team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Playoff Selections: Additional points are awarded for the correct selection of teams for the playoff rounds.
              <ul>
                <li>2 points for each team in the round of sixteen</li>
                <li>3 points for each quarter-finalist</li>
